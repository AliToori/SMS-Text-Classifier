# SMS Text Classifier using TensorFlow Sequential Neural Network

This project implements an SMS text classification system using a Sequential Neural Network with Embedding and Dense Layers in TensorFlow, developed as part of the freeCodeCamp Machine Learning with Python certification. The goal is to classify SMS messages as either "ham" (normal messages) or "spam" (advertisements or company messages) using the SMS Spam Collection dataset.

### Project Overview
The project involves:
1. Loading and preprocessing the insurance dataset, encoding categorical variables (sex, smoker, region), and normalizing numerical features.
2. Splitting the dataset into 80% training and 20% testing sets, with the target variable (`expenses`) separated as labels.
3. Building a Linear Regression model using TensorFlow’s `Sequential` API with a single dense layer.
4. Training the model to minimize MAE and evaluating it to ensure MAE < 3500 on the test set.
5. Visualizing predicted vs. actual expenses using a scatter plot.
6. Implementing the logic in a modular, class-based Python script (`HealthcareCostsPredictor.py`) for reusability.

Example output from the evaluation:
```bash
Testing set Mean Abs Error: 2456.78 expenses
You passed the challenge. Great job!
```
(A scatter plot shows predicted vs. actual expenses with a 1:1 reference line.)

## 🛠 Tech Stack
* Language: Python 3.10+
* Libraries:
  * TensorFlow (for Linear Regression model with `Sequential` API)
  * Pandas (for data preprocessing and manipulation)
  * NumPy (for numerical operations)
  * Scikit-learn (for `LabelEncoder`, `StandardScaler`, and `train_test_split`)
  * Matplotlib (for visualization)
* Tools:
  * Google Colab for development, training, and testing (with GPU support)
  * GitHub for version control

---

## 📂 Project Structure
The project includes:
* `HealthcareCostsPredictor.py`: A class-based Python script with methods for loading, preprocessing, building, training, evaluating, and visualizing the model.
* `insurance.csv`: The dataset (downloaded automatically from [https://cdn.freecodecamp.org/project-data/health-costs/insurance.csv](https://cdn.freecodecamp.org/project-data/health-costs/insurance.csv)).
* Colab Notebook (optional): A four-cell notebook implementing the same logic sequentially (import libraries, load data, preprocess/train, evaluate/visualize).
* `README.md`: This file.

Dataset structure:
```bash
insurance.csv: Contains features (age, sex, bmi, children, smoker, region) and target (expenses)
```

## Usage
### Python Script
1. Save `HealthcareCostsPredictor.py` locally.
2. Install required libraries:
   ```bash
   pip install pandas numpy tensorflow scikit-learn matplotlib
   ```
3. Run the script:
   ```bash
   python HealthcareCostsPredictor.py
   ```
4. The script will:
   - Download the dataset if not already present
   - Preprocess data (encode categorical variables, normalize features, split into 80% train/20% test)
   - Build and train a TensorFlow Linear Regression model
   - Evaluate the model (prints MAE, typically ~2000-2500)
   - Display a scatter plot of predicted vs. actual expenses

### Colab Notebook (Optional)
1. Open the Colab notebook: [Link to your notebook, e.g., https://colab.research.google.com/drive/1YhqiUuH22rZCzQpfbL8msT8cHZ4J_uGR]
2. Save a copy to your Google Drive (**File > Save a copy in Drive**).
3. Enable GPU for faster training (**Runtime > Change runtime type > GPU**).
4. Run all cells sequentially:
   - Cell 1: Import libraries and install tensorflow-docs
   - Cell 2: Load the dataset
   - Cell 3: Preprocess data and train the model
   - Cell 4: Evaluate the model and visualize results
5. Ensure the notebook’s sharing settings are “anyone with the link” for submission.
